# YOLOv8 Custom Layers

This repository is a fork of the YOLOv8 repository, specifically designed to add custom layers to the YOLOv8 model.

## Introduction

YOLOv8 is a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm that achieves high accuracy and real-time performance. However, it may not always have the necessary layers to suit specific use cases. This forked repository aims to address this limitation by providing a framework to easily add custom layers to the YOLOv8 model.

## Features

- Forked from the original YOLOv8 repository
- Allows for the addition of custom layers to the YOLOv8 model
- Maintains the high accuracy and real-time performance of YOLOv8
- Provides a user-friendly interface for adding and configuring custom layers

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Add your custom layers to the YOLOv8 model.
4. Train and evaluate the modified YOLOv8 model.
5. Integrate the custom layers into your own projects.
